I want to look into the situtation where if you move your phone your compass works out for camera movement.
Many AR applications can use this functionality.
Well I was thinking of creating a Sightseeing Video call with MultiPlayer in the same place which gives you the virtual presence of people in the scene but for mobile platforms.
You can choose a spot fo eg two spots available after you select if you move your mobile phone towards the direction of other user you will see their model
